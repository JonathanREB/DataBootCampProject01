##Project Description:
We will analyze MejorCompraTV’s sales performance in 5 retail chains: Coppel, Elektra, Liverpool, Sears and Sanborn’s.
##Research questions to answer:
 The specific analyses are dependent on data availability but our initial ideas include:
*Sales vs geographical region in general and by product category and price tier
*Sales distribution per time period (day of the week or week of the month, depending on available data)
*Sales vs rain
*Optimal inventory per retail outlet to maximize sales and minimize working capital costs
*Cannibalization effect when introducing a product extension 
*Effect of twitter trends on product sales
*Speech analysis of sales calls (from telemarketing sales)
##Data Sets to be Used:
*MejorCompraTv Sales data
*Google API
*Twitter API
*OpenWeather API
